Revision history for Text-Fragment

0.03    2014-10-31 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] Inserting at the bottom of empty string should add
	  ending newline.


0.02    2014-10-31 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] fragment with longer ID e.g. foo-bar will match shorter
	  ID (e.g. foo).

	- Relax ID so it can contain dashes, underscores, dots, commas,
	  colons (I happen to want to use program names as ID's).


0.01    2012-09-12 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release, extracted/renamed from Setup-Text-Snippet because
          Text::Snippet was already taken.
